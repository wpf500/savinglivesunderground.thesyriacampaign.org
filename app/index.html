                <b>Health facilities in Syria are systematically targeted on a
                scale unprecedented in modern history.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                There have been over 454 attacks on hospitals in the last six
                years, with 91% of the attacks perpetrated by the Assad government
                and Russia. During the last six months of 2016, the rate of
                attacks on healthcare increased dramatically. Most recently, in
                April 2017 alone, there were 25 attacks on medical facilities, or
                one attack every 29 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>While the international community fails to protect Syrian
                medics from systematic aerial attacks on their hospitals,
                Syrians have developed an entire underground system to help
                protect patients and medical colleagues as best they can.</b> The
                fortification of medical facilities is now considered a
                standard practice in Syria. Field hospitals have been driven
                underground, into basements, fortified with sandbags and cement
                walls, and into caves. These facilities have saved the lives of
                countless health workers and patients, preserved critical
                donor-funded equipment, and helped prevent displacement by
                providing communities with emergency care. <b>However, while
                Syrian medics have adapted their operations to fit these unique
                horrors, international donor governments have not adapted their
                funding.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Donors often see the reinforcement and building of underground
                medical facilities exclusively as long-term aid, or development
                work. However, as the Syria crisis is classified as a
                protracted emergency conflict, medical organizations do not
                currently have access to such long-term funds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Budget lines for the emergency funding they receive can include
                “protection” work, but infrastructure building, even for
                protective purposes, often falls outside of their mandate.  The
                divide between emergency humanitarian and development funding
                is creating a gap for projects that bridge the two, like
                protective measures for hospitals in Syria. Medics are paying
                the price.

                        The Idlib governorate is a priority area for
                        fortification, especially as attacks using advanced
                        weapons like bunker buster bombs and chemical weapons
                        escalate. It costs only $719,000 to re-fortify all of
                        the existing priority facilities identified in Idlib.
